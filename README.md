# Introduction to Robotics
Repo for the "Introduction to Robotics" optional course, from the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, University of Bucharest.
## Homework 0
I installed the Arduino IDE and I set up the repo (and subsequently translated it to English).

## Homework 1
Requirements: "Use a separate potentiometer in controlling each of the color of the RGB led (Red, Green and Blue). The control must be done with digital electronics (aka you must read the value of the potentiometer with Arduino, and write a mapped value to each of the pins connectedto the led)."

Notes: due to not having a sufficient amount of wires, I had to use resistors to connect certain components. I tried using the smallest available resistors (they should have no more than 10 ohms) and it seems to have a small, barely noticeable effect on the end result. Unfortunately, I didn't find a way around this.
